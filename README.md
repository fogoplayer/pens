### [AirOS Desktop](https://github.com/fogoplayer/pens/tree/main/air-os)

When I was a teenager, I started drawing up mockups of a desktop interface designed to look clean and futuristic. When I learned about `transform: skew()`, I recognized that it allowed me to make the parallelograms that formed the core of AirOS's design language, so I whipped up a quick mockup. It doesn't look good, and it's not supposed to--this was a gleeful reaction to the discovery of new possibilities.

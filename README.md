# pens

A series of snippets and scripts that I made for my own use. Due to their small size and personal application, I didn't feel like each deserved their own repo, but I still wanted to publish them in case anyone else finds them useful (and to free up space on my drive).

## Pages

Some my projects involve HTML. They are:

### [AirOS Desktop](./air-os)

### [Bookmarklets](./bookmarklets)

### [Buc-ee's Animation](./buccees/bucees.html)

### [PowerOfTwo](./power-of-two/power-of-two.html)
